Some utility codes for testing frame interpolation


# Bayesian Optimization
* ```python3 bayesian_optimization.py -h``` to know the detail

* For example, ```python3 bayesian_optimization.py --dataset_dir test_imgs/ --bin_file ../../innocompute/build/demos/frame_interp/innocompute_examples_frame_interp```


## CUDA version of PSNR
In case PSNR computation is too slow but now python PSNR looks OK for me.
